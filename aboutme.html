            Hello! My name is Nick, I am a Full-Stack Developer currently enrolled in highschool.
            My knowledge in computer programming is entirely self-taught over the last many years
            of my life. I really began to expand my knowledge when I was 13, which is when I began
            modding games. Video games have been a part of my life as long as I can remember.
